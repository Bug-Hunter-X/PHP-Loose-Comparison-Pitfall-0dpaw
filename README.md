# PHP Loose Comparison Pitfall

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to loose comparison using the strict equality operator (===). The example shows how this can lead to unexpected results when comparing values of different types.  The solution shows how to use loose comparison (==) for type-independent comparison if necessary, with appropriate type checks for safer code.
